# Reinforcement Learning in Swift

An experiment in implementing Deep Reinforcement Learning in Swift using the
MLCompute framework for training neural networks. Includes a DQN agent and a
REINFORCE agent. The DQN agent trains using experience replay and target
Q-values instead of TD-loss. The REINFORCE agent trains using target action
probabilties instead of policy gradient.
